## 🔍 Objectives

1. Inspect and clean the dataset.
2. Visualize key trends and correlations.
3. Analyze factors contributing to wins and losses.
4. Detect outliers in scoring.
5. Compare home vs away game performances.
6. Understand defensive impact on game results.
7. Examine 3-point shot reliance.
8. Evaluate team performance in clutch (close) games.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Correlation heatmaps
- Histograms
- Boxplots (for outlier detection)
- Pie chart (home vs away win rate)
- Bar plots (defensive metrics and clutch game performance)
- Monthly trend heatmaps (3-point shot analysis)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive development)

## 📌 Key Findings

- Strong correlation between points scored and field goals/free throws.
- Teams tend to win more at home.
- Better defensive stats (steals, blocks) often lead to wins.
- Some teams excel in high-pressure (clutch) situations.
- 3-point strategy has evolved over time and differs based on game outcome.
